Summary
-------
A method for extracting and decoding binary data from pseudo-JSON

This is designed to be used in eg Bayeux messages where it may be
useful to compress the data (eg with lzo) but not the channel or id.

Two formats are currently available:

1. BOJ
	["BOJ",<length of binary data>,<arbirtary binary data>]

	This is for single items

2. BOJT (BOJ with table of contents)
	["BOJT",<length of table>,<table>]

	The table is of the form: [[offset1,length1],...]
	The table may be compressed.
